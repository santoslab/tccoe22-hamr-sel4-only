<p>An OVA (Open Virtual Appliance) has been created that has all the development tools that will be used in this tutorial preinstalled. You will need a virtualization provider that is capable of importing the OVA such as VMWare or VirtualBox.  We recommend using VirtualBox as it is free/open-source and can be downloaded via </p>

<ol>
<li>Download the 6.7GB OVA <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16bCMkBtSoHY9fZKJIEKdMjQK5K5C7w0P/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.</li>
<li>In VirtualBox choose <code>File &gt;&gt; Import Appliance</code></li>
<li>Point to the location of the downloaded <code>tccoe22.ova</code> file in the dialog box that opens and click <code>Continue</code>.</li>
<li>Review the appliance settings in the next dialog box and choose <code>Import</code>.  This may take a couple of minutes to complete.</li>
